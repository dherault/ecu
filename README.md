# ecu

A self-reprogramming shield for React apps

## About

Ecu is a Figma open-source alternative that allows React developers to create any app in a fraction of the time required to code it "manually".

It acts as a shield around your app to reprogram it as you create new components, style them, drag-and-drop them into the app, and so on.

## Current features

- Create components
- Insert component in hierarchy
- Delete component from hierarchy
- Manage component imports
- Manage component prop types
- Manage global types

## Roadmap

- Style components
- Undo/Redo
- Drag-and-drop components

And much more!

## Development

Run `npm i` in the root, `app`, `packages/ecu-client`, and `packages/ecu-server` directories.

Then run `npm run dev` in the `packages/ecu-server` and `packages/ecu-client` directories.

Then run `npm run dev:app` in the root directory.
